   <div style="text-align: justify;"><P>Football, or association football or soccer, Game in which two 11-
       member teams try to propel a ball into the opposing team’s goal, using any part of the body except 
       the hands and arms. Only the goalkeeper, when positioned within the penalty area in front
        of the goal, may use hands and arms. The game’s first uniform set of rules was put in place 
        in 1863, when England’s Football Association was created. Professional leagues began appearing in 
        the late 1880s, first in England and then in other countries. The Fédération Internationale de 
        Football Association (FIFA) was founded in 1904, and has hosted the World Cup every four years since
         1930. Football has been included in the Olympic Games since 1908. Now played on all continents in
          over 200 countries, with over 250 million players, it is the world’s most popular sport.</P></div>
